# Blueprint: Panacea International School Website (v2)

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for rebuilding the Panacea International School website with a modern, expensive, and cool aesthetic. The website will have a specific section order on the homepage, modern design elements, and improved user experience on all pages.

2.  **Admissions Section**: "ADMISSION OPEN" in big, bold text with contact information below.
3.  **Our Toppers Section**: A grid of topper images and names that pop out on hover.
4.  **Why Choose Us Section**: A section with relevant images for each feature.
5.  **Latest News Section**: An auto-scrolling list of news updates.
6.  **Footer**: A comprehensive footer.

## Design and Animations

*   **Aesthetics**: The website will have a modern, expensive, and cool look and feel.
